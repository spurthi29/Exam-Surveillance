## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Captures video streams to monitor student activities during exams.
- **Suspicious Activity Detection:** Utilizes machine learning models to identify behaviors that may indicate cheating.
- **Alert Generation:** Sends notifications for detected anomalies to the supervising authorities.
- **Flexible Input Sources:** Supports various input sources including webcam, video files, and live streams.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for programming and logic implementation.
- **OpenCV** for video processing and computer vision tasks.
- **PyTorch or TensorFlow** for building and deploying machine learning models.
- **gTTS** for generating audio alerts.
- **Mutagen** for handling audio file formats.
- **Pygame** for playing audio alerts.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/exam-surveillance-ml.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd exam-surveillance-ml
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the surveillance system, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python main.py --source <video_source>
```
Replace `<video_source>` with the path to your video file, webcam index, or URL.

### Command-Line Arguments

- `--weights`: Path to the trained model file (e.g., `best.pt`).
- `--source`: Input source for monitoring (e.g., `0` for webcam, `video.mp4` for video file).
- `--imgsz`: Inference size (height, width).
- `--conf-thres`: Confidence threshold for detection.
- `--save-txt`: Save results to text files.
- `--view-img`: Display results in a window.

## Examples

Here are some examples of the output generated by the surveillance system:

- **Monitoring a Live Exam:** Captures real-time activities in an examination hall.
- **Cheating Detection Alerts:** Generates audio alerts when suspicious behavior is detected.

*Include screenshots or videos of your system in action here.*

### Tips for Writing Your README

1. **Clarity:** Use straightforward language and keep explanations clear.
2. **Visuals:** Add images or GIFs of your application in action to make it more engaging.
3. **Code Blocks:** Use code blocks for any commands or snippets to improve readability.
4. **Regular Updates:** Keep the README updated as your project evolves.

Feel free to adapt this template to fit your project's specifics!
